## 📌 About Me

Hello! I'm **Justin Frederline Wijaya**, also known as **JustinKt_**.

I am a **Game Programmer** with a strong passion for game development, particularly **simulator and top-down shooter games**. I thoroughly enjoy the process of building *core gameplay*, creating modular systems, and ensuring that the games I create provide a great experience for a wide audience.

Currently, I am actively developing games using **Unity (C#)**, with a focus on programming. Additionally, I explore game development on the **Roblox** platform using **Lua**, specifically in creating gameplay logic and interactive systems.

Outside of game development, I have a basic understanding of web development using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, which helps me understand the overall application workflow.

🎓 Currently, I am a student at **BINUS University**, majoring in **Game Application Technology**, 5th semester.

> **Specialization Interests:** > Game Programming — Unity (C#), Lua, Roblox
